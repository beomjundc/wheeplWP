Wheepl widget enables blogs to have a live, unified conversation through hashtags.

== Description ==

Wheepl widget is a cross-page, live social commenting system. Integrate conversations on your blog with other webpages, blogs, and Twitter through hashtags, with a chat/message like interface that promotes real-time user engagement.

CROSS-PAGE INTEGRATION
Integrate conversations across webpages or blogs. Choose your hashtags - share hashtags with blogger networks - draw users into the same live conversation.

2-WAY TWITTER INTEGRATION
Seamless and direct integration. Tweets are displayed based on the hashtag and hence we support true cross platform conversations.

100% FREE WITH NO-ADS
Wheepl widget is and will always be free to ninjas. Enjoy our current features and look forward to more free, ‘premium’ ones.

ENGAGE USERS
Hosting a comment system with little or no comments does not drive user engagement. Have users experience the next generation of social commenting - live and across the web.
