wheepl widget enables blogs to have a live, unified conversation through hashtags.

== Description ==

Conversations, communities, people, interests, issues, networks all exist in isolation in our social web. We see a web not of social networks, websites and blogs but one of unity.

wheepl widget is a cross-page live social commenting system. The widget integrates conversation across webpages based on hashtags chosen by the widget host.
